            description: "As a Fullstack Developer with 1.9 years of experience, I have specialized in building dynamic, high-performance web applications with a strong emphasis on frontend technologies, including Angular (8/12/15/17) and ReactJS. My expertise in TypeScript and JavaScript has allowed me to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code, adhering to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. I have a solid foundation in AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and EC2, which I have leveraged to build serverless, scalable backend solutions. My proficiency in UI/UX design, utilizing tools like Figma and Adobe XD, ensures seamless and user-friendly experiences, while my use of frameworks like Material UI, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap has consistently enhanced the visual appeal and responsiveness of web applications. I am well-versed in agile practices, having worked within cross-functional teams using Jira to deliver features in a fast-paced environment. Additionally, my experience with Jenkins, AWS CodeCommit, and Node.js has enabled me to automate build and deployment processes, optimizing development workflows and ensuring faster time-to-market.",
